## avif

AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) is an encoding based on the open source AV1 video codec. AVIF is even newerâ€”than WebP, only supported in Chrome and Opera since 2020, Firefox in 2021, and Safari in 2022. As with WebP, AVIF aims to address every conceivable use case for raster images on the web: GIF-like animation, PNG-like transparency, and improved perceptual quality at file sizes smaller than JPEG or WebP.
