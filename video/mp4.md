## MP4Box
The multimedia packager available in GPAC is called MP4Box.
It can be used for performing many manipulations on multimedia files like AVI, MPG, TS, but mostly on ISO media files (e.g. MP4, 3GP). A complete documentation is available here.
In short, MP4Box can be used:
- for manipulating ISO files like MP4, 3GP: adding, removing, multiplexing audio, video and presentation data (including subtitles) from different sources and in different formats,
- for encoding/decoding presentation languages like MPEG-4 XMT or W3C SVG into/from binary formats like MPEG-4 BIFS or LASeR,
- for performing encryption of streams
- for attaching metadata to individual streams or to the whole ISO file to produce MPEG-21 compliant or hybrid MPEG-4/MPEG-21 files
- for preparation of HTTP Adaptive Streaming content,
- and packaging and tagging the result for streaming, download and playback on different devices (e.g. phones, tablets) or for different software (e.g. iTunes).
It is widely used: by the video community, by many cloud infrastructures for preparation of multimedia files for playback, especially for iTunes/iOS and PlayStation, and by academics.
