## mlpack
mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs, Python bindings, and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale machine learning solutions.
